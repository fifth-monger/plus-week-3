    <h1>JS Data Types Homework</h1>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>
      Include the JavaScript file provided in your project, when loading your
      project, ask the user "Enter a city".
    </p>
    <p>
      Example: Paris
      <br />Alert: "It is currently 19°C (66°F) in Paris with a humidity of 80%"
    </p>
    <p>
      If the city doesn't exist in the object (i.e: Sydney)
      <br />Alert: "Sorry, we don't know the weather for this city, try going to
      https://www.google.com/search?q=weather+sydney". <br />Since this is an
      alert, the link shouldn't be clickable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Add this behavior to your project and submit the CodeSandbox URL
      <br />Note: Please round the values in the Alert to the nearest whole
      number (no decimal points, e.g. 5.45 should be rounded to 5).
